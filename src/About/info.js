        question:"Where to Stay?",
        answer: "A big aspect of sustainable tourism is its focus on local communities and making sure your money goes directly into the local economy. A great way to ensure this is by choosing local, independently operated hotels or accommodation rather than an international hotel chain. Additionally, you can research hotels that operate using sustainable practices or have green initiatives in place. Often, the hotelâ€™s websites will indicate if they have green practices, such as using renewable energy, water reduction methods or sourcing fresh, local produce."
